    </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
```

- [ ] The `<car>` element can be extended with only one attribute
- [x] The `<car>` element can be extended with multiple attributes
- [ ] The `<car>` element cannot have any attributes

          <p>Content goes here ...</p>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```
- [ ]
  ```xml
  <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <head><title>XHTML Example</title></head>
      <body name="bodySection">
          <p><b>Content goes here ...</b></p>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```
- [ ]
  ```xml
  <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <head><title>XHTML Example</title></head>
      <body color="#333333">
          <p><i>Content goes here ...</i></p>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```
- [x]
  ```xml
  <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <head><title>XHTML Example</title></head>
      <body id="bodySelection">
          <p><strong>Content goes here ...</strong></p>
      </body>
  </html>
  ```

#### Q4. When working with Ajax applications, which is faster, XML or JSON?

- [ ] XML, because it is extensible
- [x] JSON, because it transfers data without waiting for a server response
- [ ] XML, because it supports namespaces
- [ ] JSON, because it is already parsed into a JavaScript object

#### Q5. Asynchronous Javascript and XML (Ajax) is technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications. In addition to JavaScript and XML on the back end, which technologies are commonly used to craft AJAX experiences on the front end?

- [ ] PHP, .NET, and SQL

- [ ] XHTML attribute values must be quoted
- [x] XHTML tags and attributes must be in lowercase
- [ ] XHTML elements must be properly nested within each other.
- [ ] XHTML tags must have an equivalent closing tag.

**Explanation**: XML Attributes values [must be quoted](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_attributes.asp). Element names are [case-sensitive](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_elements.asp) (and CamelCase is actually one of the naming styles).

<x a="x" a="y"></x>
```

- [x] improperly named element
- [ ] self-closing tag
- [ ] null element
- [ ] incorrect XML syntax

#### Q11. XML provides a framework for specifying markup languages, while HTML is a predefined markup language. What is applicable to XML and not HTML?

- [x] It is mandatory to use closing tags with XML
- [ ] It is important for an XML document to be well formed
- [ ] XML elements start with an opening tag in angle brackets, such as `<p>`
- [ ] XML syntax uses tags, elements, and attributes

#### Q12. What is the last step in extending XHTML modules?

- [ ] The last step is to complete the extension of XHTML compound documents and make sure the documents adhere to the defined namespaces.
- [x] The last step is to create the DTD for the XHTML extension, which references both the XHTML modules and the new modules.
- [ ] The last step is to run the XHTML extension through the XSLT processor, which will properly format it.

- [x] `#DEFAULT`
- [ ] `#OPTIONAL`
- [ ] `#IMPLIED`
- [ ] `#FIXED`

- [x] `<xsl:apply-templates>` and `<xsl:call-template>`
- [ ] `<xsl:param>` and `<xsl:processing-instruction>`
- [ ] `<xsl:template>` and `<xsl:transform>`
- [ ] `<xsl:include>` and `<xsl:variable>`

#### Q17. You are checking someone else's XML document for errors. You notice that the prolog does not have a closing tag. What do you do?

- [ ] Remove the prolog to make sure that the XML document will be properly processed across all platforms.
- [x] Leave it alone, because the prolog does not require a closing tag.
- [ ] Move the prolog to an external file so that the XML document only has elements with closing tags.
- [ ] Add a closing tag, as al XML elements must have a closing tag.

#### Q18. Which statement is not true about XML?

- [ ] XML is flexible and customizable.
- [ ] XML can be used to store data.
- [ ] XML is independent of Operating System.

- [ ] `<!ATTLIST car color (red|white|blue|black) black>`
- [ ] `<!ATTLIST car color (red|white|blue|black) #REQUIRED>`
- [x] `<!ATTLIST car color (red|white|blue|black) #FIXED>`
- [ ] `<!ATTLIST car color (red|white|blue|black)>`

#### Q22. The main ways to control the display of XML documents are with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Extensible Styles Language (XSL). What is an advantage of CSS over XSL?

- [ ] CSS is a complete programming language with more powerful syntax.
- [ ] With CSS, the same element can be processed multiple times.
- [ ] CSS allows you to reformat data into completely new structures.

<cars>
    <car>
        <make>Cadillac
            <model>Escalade</model>
            <price year="2007">$20,000</price>
        </make>
    </car>
</cars>
```

- [ ] Cadillac
- [ ] Cadillac Escalade
- [ ] Cadillac Escalade 20000
- [x] Cadillac Escalade $20,000

#### Q27. You need to display the list of cars in the code snippet below in a column format, with a counter column for each row. Which XPath function do you use for the counter?

```xml
<cars>
    <car><make>Cadillac</make> <model>Escalade</model> <year>2007</year></car>

</cars>
```

- [ ] `format-number()`
- [ ] `id()`
- [ ] `count()`
- [x] `position()`

**Explanation**: [count()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions/count) returns the total the number of nodes (3), while [position()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions/position) returns the 0-based index of each node.

    <car><make>Mercedes</make> <model>C-Class</model> <year>2009</year></car>
</cars>
```

- [ ]

```xquery
<ul>
{
    for $x in doc("cars.xml")/cars/car
    where $x/year>2000
    order by $x/year descending
    return <li>{$x}</li>
}
</ul>
```

- [ ]

```xquery
<ol>
{
    for $x in doc("cars.xml")/cars/car
    where $x/year>2000
    order by $x/year desc
    return <li>{data($x)}</li>
}
</ol>
```

- [ ]

```xquery
<ul>
{
    for $x in doc("cars.xml")/cars/car
    where $x/year>2000
    order by $x/year
    return <li>{$x}</li>
}
</ul>
```

- [x]

```xquery
<ol>
{
    for $x in doc("cars.xml")/cars/car
    where $x/year>2000
    order by $x/year descending
    return <li>{data($x)}</li>
}
</ol>
```

- [ ] `4 (DONE)`
- [ ] `3 (LOADING)`
- [x] `1 (PROCESSING)`
- [ ] `0 (UNSENT)`

[reference link:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/readyState)

#### Q30. You are working with an XML document that uses an XML schema. How can you extend the document with elements NOT specified by the schema?

- [x] Use the `<any>` element.
- [ ] Use the `<redefine>` element.
- [ ] Use `<xs:extension>`.
- [ ] Specify the new elements in the schema.

[reference link:](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_complex_any.asp)

#### Q31. You are working with the following XML code snippet. Which XPath expression produces C-Class?

    <car><make>Ford</make><model>Mustang</model>
        <price year="2008">17000</price></car>
    <car><make>Mercedes</make><model>C-Class</model>
        <price year="2009">24000</price></car>
</cars>
```

- [ ] `/car[price>20000]/make/model`
- [ ] `/car[price>=20000 and @year>=2009]/make/model`
- [ ] `//car[price>=20000 and @year>2008]/model`
- [ ] `/cars/car[price>=20000 and year>2008]/model`

#### Q32. You are working with an XML document that uses an XML schema. How do you ensure that an attribute must be specified for its corresponding element?

- [ ] Set the type attribute to `xs:required`.
- [x] Set the `use` attribute to `required`.
- [ ] Set the minLength attribute to 1.
- [ ] Set the minOccurs attribute to 1.

**Reference**: [XSD Attributres](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_simple_attributes.asp)

#### Q33. You are working with the following XML code snippet. What do you need to include in your XSLT code to display `Mercedes, Cadillac, Ford`?

```xml
<cars>
    <car><make>Cadillac</make><model>Escalade</model>
        <price year="2007">20000</price></car>
    <car><make>Ford</make><model>Mustang</model>
        <price year="2008">17000</price></car>
    <car><make>Mercedes</make><model>C-Class</model>
        <price year="2009">24000</price></car>
</cars>
```

- [ ] `<xsl:sort select="make" />`
- [x] `<xsl:sort select="model" />`
- [ ] `<xsl:sort select="car" />`
- [ ] `<xsl:sort select="price" />`

**Explanation**: A trick question. The [`<xsl:sort>`](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ref_xsl_el_sort.asp) will sort the output in ascending (alphabetical for strings) order by default. The `select` tells which tag to use for sorting.

- If we use `select="make"` or `select="year"` we get the order `Cadillac, Ford, Mercedes`
- If we use `select="price"` we get `Ford, Cadillac, Mercedes`
- And finally with `select="model"` we get `Mercedes, Cadillac, Ford`

- [x] `(: :)`

#### Q35. Which DOM node type may NOT have the EntityReference node type as one of its child nodes?

- [ ] Element
- [x] Document
- [ ] EntityReference
- [ ] DocumentFragment

[reference link:](https://www.w3schools.com/XML/dom_nodetype.asp)

#### Q36. XHTML modules can be extended by adding elements, attributes, modifying content models, or some combination of these. What does a proper implementation of an XHTML module require?

- [ ] The implementation of an XHTML module requires an extension module and a validation module that ensures that the XHTML is well formed and valid; otherwise the extended instances aren't formally XHTML.
- [ ] The implementation of an XHTML module requires a definitions module and a constraint module that specifies syntax rules and uses the parameter entities declared in the definitions module.
- [ ] The implementation of an XHTML module requires a qualified name module and a declaration module that holds the element, element attribute, and content model declarations.
- [x] The implementation of an XHTML module requires a namespace module that holds the element, element attribute, and content model declarations, and a parameter module that uses the entities declared in the namespace module.

#### Q37. The `<xsl:namespace-alias>` element is used to replace a namespace in the style sheet with a different namespace in the output. Which XSLT element needs to be its parent node?

- [ ] `<xsl:namespace>`
- [ ] any valid element
- [x] root element
- [ ] top-level element in the corresponding namespace

[reference link:](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ref_xsl_el_namespace-alias.asp)

#### Q38. XML is a markup language, not a programming language. What makes XML not qualify to be a programming language?

- [ ] XML is too flexible and does not have enough reserved keywords.
- [x] XML contains only data and not any processing instructions.
- [ ] XML does not perform any computation or algorithms.
- [ ] XML does not have specialized syntax rules.

#### Q39. What is true about these elements in XQuery?

```xml
<cars>
    <car><make>Cadillac</make><model>Escalade</model><year>2007</year></car>
    <car><make>Cadillac</make><model>Escalade</model><year>2011</year></car>

    <car><make>Ford</make><model>Mustang</model><year>1998</year></car>
    <car><make>Mercedes</make><model>C-Class</model><year>1999</year></car>
    <car><make>Mercedes</make><model>C-Class</model><year>2009</year></car>
</cars>
```

- [ ] Elements `<make>` and `<model>` are ancestors of `<year>`.
- [ ] Elements `<make>` and `<model>` are children of `<cars>`.
- [x] Elements `<make>` and `<model>` are siblings.
- [ ] Elements `<car>` and `<cars>` are parents of `<make>` and `<model>`.

#### Q40. Which is a valid CSS section for this XML code snippet?

```xml
<cars>

  display: inline;
  padding-top: 0.5em;
}
```

#### Q41. An XML document contains this code as part of the DTD: <!ELEMENT car (make, model?, year+, price*)>. What are the rules that need to be followed for each of the elements?

- [ ] <make> is required, <model> is optional, <year> is optional, and <price> is optional.
- [ ] <make> is required, <model> is required, <year> is optional, and <price> is optional.
